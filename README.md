> FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT [HERE](https://github.com/SrRapero720/EmbeddiumAdditions)

This mod is going to be **REWRITED FROM SCRATCH**, to complete disconnect it from "upstream" 
(which was already done in 1.2.0 but somehow people still considers it "a fork").

New version will be renamed to Embeddium++Additions with brand-new™ features on quality, performance, compat.
enhanced own made video settings screen and much more.

**AH, YES, ALSO WILL HAVE A FABRIC PORT FOR EMBEDDIUM FABRIC**

# 🔧 FEATURES

### [⚡] PERFORMANCE

# 🔰 VERSION 1.16.5

I decide to skip that version in favor of
[Embeddium Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embeddium-extras) by PotatoBoy (aka TexTure).
It Is too good like Embeddium++, Shares features and has more Performance fixes and features.

# ⏩ THE FUTURE OF EMBEDDIUM++
Before I place some jokes, but this time I am 100% sure. 
All [Sodium Extras](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium-extra) features will be added
onto Embeddium++, making OBSOLETE some ports of it like Rubidium (Embeddium) Extra.

Create the first API around Sodium config page and include some misc optimization options like Cull Leaves
and quality features like Shadow Path Blocks

Sodium++ will exist...
